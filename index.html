                    <p>
                        The Classroom Communication Aide is an academic project developed CSCI 436/536: Technology for Social Good 
                        at Western Washington University. The class was taught by Dr. Shameem Ahmed in Fall 2025. Our mission is to create an ICT to address <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal4" target="_blank">SDG 4</a> by bridging the communication gap between multilingual 
                        K-12 learners and their educators.

                                In todays educational system, language barriers present significant challenges to effective classroom communication. 
                                Teachers often struggle to convey information to students who speak different primary languages, while students may feel
                                isolated or unable to express their needs and questions. Some districts have resources in place to provide support to
                                ELL's, but many do not. As a result students spend a majority of their time unassisted in a general classroom.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As of fall 2021, there were <strong>5.3 million</strong> ELL students, <strong>10.6%</strong> of all students in the United States. Outside of the United States,
                                there are a great number of students who deal with being native language learners. The frameworks for this project can be extended
                                to provide solutions for education across the world.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                We are developing this solution for K-12 teachers and their ELL students. We believe this solution would be a great tool that would improve
                                the learning experience of ELL students, especially in regions or schools that lack existing resources.

                <!-- Solution -->
                <section id="solution" class="content-section">
                    <h2>Our Solution</h2>
                    <p>
                        We decided to develop an accessible web application that could be used across a wide range of devices. We developed our solution to focus on using
                        visual aids, to begin introducing the association between objects and their pronunciations. We focused on improving the interactions between multilingual 
                        students and their teachers, as we decided to implement real time two-way translation to help facilitate communications.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our application will support essential requests such as <strong>"I need water"</strong> or <strong>"I don't understand"</strong> with the use of visual aids to help student build language association.
                        We will create a default set of these requests to ensure
                        a clear signal can be sent to the teachers end of the application to resolve. Teachers will have the ability to prepare and share specific materials for
                        ELLs, create shortcut sets for different classroom activities, and receive notifications when a student needs assistance.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our solution will differ from existing ones as we will have extensive support for language translation when needed. Many existing solutions exist that allow
                        a student teacher connection for sending requests, but generally lack integrated translation tools for one-on-one interaction between the student and teacher.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We focused on developing a web application as opposed to a native application as one of our main goals was compatibility. Further, a website would be the most simple solution
                        to host and manage as we would not need to work on developing an application to reach an app store. We used a suite of <strong><a href="#implementation">technologies</a></strong> that our team was 
                        familiar with and we felt would best fit the needs of our application. We developed with HTML, CSS, JS specifically using React and Tailwind for a fast
                        component based user interface. For message communication we used WebSockets for low latency and notifications.
                        Our backend API is implemented with Node.js to handle our business logic and integrations, with Supabase to host our PostgreSQL database and manage user authentication.

                            <li>Beyond language barriers, ELL students may experience cultural barriers that can impact their feeling of belongingness or their connection to their teacher. Representation is an important thing to keep in mind.</li>
                            <li>School districts provide Google Chromebooks to students.</li>
                            <li>There are often hand signals used in class for needs to prevent interrupting the class.</li>
                            <li>ELL students start at a wide variety of levels, from kids who have never been in school or know how to read in their native language, to those who learn fast. Their initial understanding, as well as how fast they learn English, is very different for every kid. Teachers must handle many different changing levels at once.</li>
                            <li>From the perspective of teachers, the use of translation tools such as Google Translate go a long way when working with ELLs in the classroom. Integrating a tool like this into an application would be a huge benefit.</li>
                            <li>Existing tools struggle to incorporate a full suite of features. In other words, applications exist to provide singular functions in the classroom, but there are not many solutions that integrate multiple functions.</li>

                                <strong>Login Page</strong><br>The login page for the website is accessed from the landing page. We have two login methods, one with an email and password and the other using Google OAuth. When a user registers an account, either with OAuth or email, they will need to complete their account registration with a username and eventually other fields which will be used within the application.

The command buttons allow the student to send basic needs requests directly to their teacher. They can add and edit the appearance of certain buttons using the edit button. The student can use also use the message bar to send a private and unique message to their teacher, and use the translator button to open up the translator page.

There’s also a profile page, where a teacher can register their class to get a unique class code for students to register with.
